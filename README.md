Lab 5: The World I See
=======================

*Goal: Integrate computer vision with voice control to enable Pupper to track objects and respond to visual commands using multimodal AI!*

In this lab, you'll combine computer vision, voice interaction, and AI to create an intelligent robot that can:

- **See and understand** its environment through camera input
- **Track objects** like people, dogs, cats, and 80+ other COCO dataset objects  
- **Respond to voice commands** with visual context (e.g., "Follow that person", "What do you see?")
- **Use multimodal AI** that processes both audio and visual input simultaneously

This lab builds on Lab 6's voice control by adding vision capabilities, creating a truly multimodal AI experience where Pupper can see what you're talking about!

**Note:** This lab is long and challenging, so please start early and ask questions if you get stuck. We're here to help!

**Key Technologies:**

- **HAILO-8L AI accelerator** for real-time object detection
- **OpenAI Realtime API** with multimodal support (audio + vision)
- **ROS2 state machine** for robust tracking behavior
- **Foxglove** for real-time visualization

## Step 1. Visualization Setup

1. **Install Foxglove**  
   
   Create an accountat [foxglove home](https://foxglove.dev/) then install [Foxglove app](https://foxglove.dev/download) locally on your computer (not the browser version).

   Foxglove will be your primary visualization tool for seeing camera feeds, object detections, and robot state in real time.

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Create python virtual environment for python packages
   ```
   python -m venv lab5_env
   ```
   
   Install the required dependencies (downgrading numpy to a version below 2.0.0 is **crucial**):

   ```bash
   pip install supervision loguru pygame sounddevice websockets numpy==1.26.0
   ```
3. Open the [lab 7 code repository](https://github.com/cs123-stanford/lab_7_fall_2025) on your GitHub account. Then, fork the repository to your own GitHub account following the instructions in :doc:`forking_repositories`.

4. Clone the forked repository to your Raspberry Pi:

   ```
   cd ~/
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/lab_7_fall_2025.git
   ```

   Note: Replace ``YOUR_USERNAME`` with your actual GitHub username.

5. Open the lab 7 folder in VSCode


   ```
   cd ~/lab_7_fall_2025
   code .
   ```

6. **Configure API Keys**

   Set up your OpenAI API key for multimodal voice interaction:

   ```
   python setup_api_keys.py
   ```

   Follow the prompts to enter your OpenAI API key. This enables the multimodal Realtime API that processes both audio and vision.

7. **Review the Lab Structure**

   The lab follows a progressive workflow:
   
   - **Visualization** (``run_foxglove.sh``) → See camera feed and detections
   - **Tracking Logic** (``lab_7.py``) → Implement state machine for object tracking  
   - **Karel API** (``karel.py``) → Add tracking commands to robot control
   - **Testing** (``run_tracking.sh``) → Test tracking without voice
   - **Voice + Vision** (``realtime_voice.py``) → Add multimodal AI capabilities
   - **Command Parsing** (``karel_realtime_commander.py``) → Parse voice commands with tracking
   - **Full System** (``run_full_system.sh``) → Complete integrated experience

   **Important Note on Process Management**: This lab involves many interconnected components (camera, object detection, state machine, voice processing, etc.). Unlike previous labs where you might open multiple terminals, we've provided launch scripts that handle all the process management for you. For each step, you'll typically just need to open **one terminal** and run the appropriate bash script. The scripts automatically start all necessary background processes and handle cleanup when you stop them with Ctrl+C. This makes the lab much more manageable!

### Step 1. Visualization Setup

First, let's get the visualization system running so you can see what Pupper sees.

1. **Start Foxglove Visualization**

   Launch the visualization system:
   ```
   pip install rclpy
   ```

   ```
   cd ~/lab_7_fall_2025
   bash scripts/run_foxglove.sh
   ```

   This starts:

      - ROS2 camera and control systems
      - Foxglove bridge for visualization  
      - HAILO object detection with bounding boxes

2. **Connect Foxglove to Pupper**  
   
   #. Connect your laptop to Pupper via Ethernet cable
   #. SSH with port forwarding: ``ssh -A -L 8765:localhost:8765 pi@pupper[GROUP_NUMBER].local``
   #. Open Foxglove, click ``Open Connection``, use default websocket URL ``ws://localhost:8765``

        .. figure:: ../../../_static/vision_lab/connect_localhost.png
            :align: center

            Connecting Foxglove to the Raspberry Pi.

   #. Configure the image panel:
      - Click the gear icon on the image panel
      - Set topic to ``/annotated_image`` 
      - Set calibration to ``None``
      - Go fullscreen for better visibility

        .. figure:: ../../../_static/foxglove_new.png
            :align: center

            Configure the image topic to see object detections.

3. **Verify Object Detection**

   You should see a camera feed with bounding boxes around detected objects (people, dogs, cats, etc.). The system can detect 80+ different object types from the COCO dataset.

   **Note on Image Processing**: The raw fisheye camera images have been converted to equirectangular format for better object detection performance. Fisheye lenses create significant distortion that can hurt detection accuracy, so we unwarp the images to a more standard rectangular projection. If you're curious about how this works, take a look at ``fisheye_converter.py`` (totally optional) - it shows the mathematical transformation from fisheye coordinates to equirectangular coordinates.

   If you don't see detections, ask a TA. If the image is upside down, you can flip it by editing the ``hailo_detection.py`` file.

**DELIVERABLE:** Take a screenshot of Foxglove showing object detections with bounding boxes. Upload this to Gradescope.

## Step 2. Implement Tracking State Machine

Now you'll implement the core tracking logic in ``lab_7.py``. This file contains a state machine that processes object detections and controls Pupper's movement.

1. **Understand the State Machine**

   Open ``lab_7.py`` and examine the structure:
   
   - **State.IDLE**: No tracking active (allows manual Karel commands)
   - **State.SEARCH**: Rotating to search for target when lost
   - **State.TRACK**: Following detected target
   
   The state machine receives:
   - Object detections from ``/detections`` topic
   - Tracking control commands from ``/tracking_control`` topic

2. **Implement Detection Processing**

   In the ``detection_callback`` function, you'll need to process incoming detection messages. Look at the ROS message structure and figure out how to:

   - Extract detection data from the message
   - Determine the position of detected objects in the image
   - Normalize positions so the center of the image is at 0
   - Decide which detection to track when multiple objects are present
   - Keep track of when detections occur for timeout logic

   **Hint:** Check the [ROS Message Documentation](http://docs.ros.org/en/kinetic/api/vision_msgs/html/msg/Detection2DArray.html) to understand the message structure.

   **DELIVERABLE:** What line of code extracts the x-coordinate from a detection? Write the full Python expression.

3. **Implement State Transitions**

   In the ``timer_callback`` function, you need to decide when to switch between states. Think about:

   - How do you know if a detection is "recent" or "stale"?
   - What should happen when no objects have been seen for a while?
   - How do ROS timestamps work, and how do you convert them to seconds?

4. **Implement Control Logic**

   For each state, determine what motion commands make sense:

   - **SEARCH state**: How should the robot move to find a lost target?
   - **TRACK state**: How should the robot move to follow a detected target?
   
   Consider proportional control for smooth tracking and think about the direction of rotation needed.

5. **Set Constants**

   Define and tune appropriate values for:
   - ``TIMEOUT`` (seconds before switching to search)
   - ``SEARCH_YAW_VEL`` (rad/s rotation speed while searching)  
   - ``TRACK_FORWARD_VEL`` (m/s forward speed while tracking)
   - ``KP`` (proportional gain for centering)

**DELIVERABLE:** Draw a state machine diagram showing transitions between IDLE, SEARCH, and TRACK states. Include all transition conditions and upload to Gradescope.

.. note::

   **Debugging with pdb**: If your tracking behavior isn't working as expected, use Python's debugger to inspect what's happening. Add ``breakpoint()`` in your ``detection_callback`` and ``timer_callback`` functions in ``lab_7.py`` to examine:
   
   - Are detections being received? What does ``msg.detections`` contain?
   - Is ``self.target_pos`` being set correctly?
   - Are state transitions happening when you expect them to?
   - What values are your control commands (``yaw_command``, ``forward_vel_command``)?
   
   Run ``python lab_7.py`` and when it hits the breakpoint, you can inspect variables with ``p variable_name`` and step through code with ``n`` (next line) or ``c`` (continue).

Step 3. Implement Karel Tracking API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next, add tracking capabilities to the Karel API so voice commands can control the tracking system.

1. **Implement begin_tracking() Function**

   In ``pupper_llm/karel/karel.py``, you'll see a new ``begin_tracking`` method with detailed TODO comments. Study the existing code structure and figure out:

   - How to enable tracking mode in the Karel API
   - What message format the state machine expects for starting tracking
   - How to publish ROS messages and ensure they're sent

2. **Implement end_tracking() Function**

   Similarly, implement the ``end_tracking`` method by understanding:

   - How to disable tracking and clean up state
   - What message tells the state machine to stop tracking
   - How to ensure the robot stops moving when tracking ends

3. **Copy Lab 6 Movement Functions**

   Copy your implementations from Lab 6 for:

   - ``move_forward()``, ``move_backward()``, ``move_left()``, ``move_right()``
   - ``turn_left()``, ``turn_right()``
   - ``bob()``, ``dance()``

Step 4. Test Tracking System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Test your tracking implementation without voice control first.

1. **Launch Tracking Test**

.. code-block:: bash

   bash scripts/run_tracking.sh

This launches all tracking components and an interactive test script.

2. **Test Tracking Commands**

   The interactive test script will let you manually trigger tracking commands. Experiment with different object types and observe the behavior.

3. **Verify Behavior**

   Watch how Pupper behaves in different scenarios:

   - What happens when no objects are visible?
   - How does it choose which object to track when multiple are present?
   - Does the tracking feel natural and responsive?
   - How well does it handle objects moving in and out of view?

**DELIVERABLE:** Record a video of Pupper successfully tracking a person, showing search and track behaviors. Upload to Gradescope.

**DELIVERABLE:** Record a video of Pupper tracking the same person when two people are present on the screen. Talk about how you implemented the tracking logic to handle multiple objects. Upload to Gradescope.

.. note::

   **Debugging Tracking Issues**: If tracking isn't working after implementing the Karel API, the issue is likely in the communication between components. Add ``breakpoint()`` in ``lab_7.py`` to debug:
   
   - In ``tracking_control_callback``: Is the tracking control message being received? What does ``msg.data`` contain?
   - In ``detection_callback``: Are detections still being processed when tracking is enabled?
   - In ``timer_callback``: Is ``self.tracking_enabled`` set correctly? Is the state machine transitioning properly?
   
   Also check your Karel implementation - are the tracking control messages being published correctly? Add ``breakpoint()`` in ``begin_tracking()`` and ``end_tracking()`` to verify the message format and publishing.

Step 5. Implement Multimodal Voice System
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now add vision capabilities to the voice control system from Lab 6.

1. **Write System Prompt**

   In ``pupper_llm/realtime_voice.py``, you'll need to create a comprehensive system prompt that teaches GPT how to be a robot with vision. Consider:

   - What personality should Pupper have?
   - How should it describe its vision capabilities?
   - What movement and tracking commands should it support?
   - How should it format its responses so the command parser can understand them?
   - What examples would help it understand the multimodal context?

   Look at the TODO comments for guidance on the required capabilities.

2. **Implement Camera Snapshot Processing**

   Complete the ``camera_snapshot_callback`` method:

   - Convert JPEG data to base64: ``base64.b64encode(msg.data).decode('utf-8')``
   - Store in ``self.latest_camera_image_base64``
   - Set ``self.camera_image_pending = True``

3. **Implement Image Sending**

   Complete the ``send_camera_image_if_available`` method:

   - Check if image is available and pending
   - Create multimodal message with text and image content
   - Send to OpenAI Realtime API in the specified format
   - Set ``self.camera_image_pending = False``

Step 6. Implement Voice Command Parsing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Update the command parser to handle tracking commands.

1. **Copy Lab 6 Command Parsing**

   In ``pupper_llm/karel/karel_realtime_commander.py``, you'll need to bring over your Lab 6 implementations. The file has extensive TODO comments explaining what each function should do.

2. **Add Tracking Command Parsing**

   Extend your command parsing to handle tracking. Think about:

   - What different ways might someone ask to track an object?
   - How do you extract the object name from natural language?
   - What canonical command format should you use internally?

3. **Add Tracking Command Execution**

   Update your command execution to handle tracking commands. Consider:

   - How do you detect tracking-related commands?
   - What Karel API methods should you call?
   - How do you handle the timing of tracking operations?

Step 7. Full System Integration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Finally, test the complete multimodal system.

1. **Launch Full System**

.. code-block:: bash

   bash scripts/run_full_system.sh

This starts all components:

   - ROS2 control and camera
   - Object detection with HAILO
   - Tracking state machine  
   - OpenAI Realtime API with vision
   - Karel command parser

2. **Test Voice + Vision Commands**

   Experiment with natural voice commands and see how well the system understands context. Try asking about what Pupper sees, giving tracking commands, and mixing manual control with autonomous behavior.

3. **Verify Multimodal Behavior**

   Pay attention to how the system integrates different modalities:

   - Does voice control work better when Pupper can see what you're referring to?
   - How does the system handle ambiguous commands?
   - What happens when you give conflicting voice and tracking commands?
   - How natural does the interaction feel?

**DELIVERABLE:** Record a video demonstrating the full multimodal system: voice commands with visual context, object tracking, and manual control. Upload to Gradescope.

**DELIVERABLE:** Write a reflection (2-3 paragraphs) on the integration of vision and voice control. What are the advantages of multimodal AI? What challenges did you encounter? How could this system be improved?

Congratulations! You've built a sophisticated multimodal AI system that combines computer vision, voice interaction, and robotics. Pupper can now see, listen, understand, and act in the world around it!
